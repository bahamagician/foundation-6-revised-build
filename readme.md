# Revised ZURB Template to Include Fonts With Build
Certain projects that I work on cannot use external font libraries such as font awesome or google fonts.  So I've revised the [*Foundation 6*](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites) "Zurb Template" to be able to include Fonts and font folders in the gulp build process.
